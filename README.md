## 🔥 Overview

**RAVEN** is a cutting-edge, modular avionics system designed to support student-led aerospace missions across a variety of platforms. Built with a mission-critical mindset, RAVEN delivers real-time telemetry, guidance, command execution, and fault tolerance in the harshest environments — from high-altitude launches to autonomous vehicle deployments.

Developed for the **2026 IREC (Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition)** in New Mexico and field-tested at the **Lone Star Cup**, RAVEN represents the next evolution beyond our prior system, SENTINEL.

## ⚙️ System Architecture

RAVEN uses a **distributed, modular architecture** to support:

- 🚀 Parallel development & testing  
- 🔧 Plug-and-play submodules  
- 🧠 Cross-platform adaptability (rockets, rovers, remote vehicles)
