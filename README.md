# RAVEN  
**Rocket Avionics & Vehicle Execution Node**  
_A modular, high-performance flight computing system for launch vehicles, autonomous rovers, and experimental platforms._

---

## Mission Profile

**RAVEN** is a student-engineered avionics architecture developed for the 2026 IREC launch campaign. It is designed from the ground up to support modular integration, real-time decision-making, and mission reliability under extreme conditions. The system enables seamless deployment across a range of vehicles—whether rocketing through the stratosphere or navigating off-road terrain.

Built as a successor to the SENTINEL platform, RAVEN expands beyond traditional rocketry into a universal execution framework for unmanned systems.

## Core Objectives

- Deterministic real-time flight operations
- Modular subsystem development and integration
- Autonomous data collection and logging
- Hardened communication across vehicle and ground layers
- Independent verification and HIL testing of all modules

## Architecture Overview

**RAVEN** is structured around a distributed, node-based architecture. Subsystems communicate over an isolated fault-tolerant bus, enabling parallel development and full-system resiliency.
